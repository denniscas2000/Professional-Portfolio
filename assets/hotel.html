                                I developed a user-centric hotel search app as part of a UX/UI project, aiming to streamline the hotel booking experience and alleviate the common challenges users face when navigating through existing hotel apps. The primary goal of the app is to simplify the search process, offering a seamless and intuitive interface that allows users to effortlessly find and book accommodations. By focusing on user experience design, I implemented features that enhance navigation, such as a user-friendly search bar, interactive maps, and personalized recommendations based on individual preferences. The app not only provides a visually appealing design but also prioritizes functionality to ensure users have one less thing to worry about when planning their stay. Through thoughtful UX/UI considerations, the hotel search app aims to revolutionize the way users interact with hotel booking platforms, making the entire process more efficient and enjoyable.
